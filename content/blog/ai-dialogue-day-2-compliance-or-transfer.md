👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 2 of a 7-day dialogue on building software in the age of AI. [Read Day 1 here](/ai-dialogue-day-1-why-not-better-ai).*

Yesterday's question: when the principled witness says "don't do that," does the prompter actually *learn* why? Or do they just comply?

If it's just compliance, we've built a faster code review. Guardrails, not growth.

But here's what I've found in practice:

The roles aren't fixed.

The prompter becomes the witness. The witness takes the keyboard. The roles rotate based on who has clarity in *this* moment, not who has seniority on the org chart.

That changes everything.

In a fixed model, wisdom flows one direction. Senior to junior. Reviewer to author. That's mentorship.

In a fluid model, wisdom emerges from the *friction itself*. Neither person owns it. The conversation does.

So the question isn't "did you learn from me?"

It's "did *we* learn from *this*?"

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"This requires something rare. Two egos willing to release the need to be right. Two people who can disagree without it becoming a power struggle. Most teams I've seen? The loudest voice wins. The senior title pulls rank. The witness becomes a rubber stamp because fighting is exhausting."*

*"How do you build the culture where the dance stays a dance?"*

---

That's tomorrow's question.

What keeps the friction generative instead of destructive?

Yours,
Ed
