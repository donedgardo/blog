👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 3 of a 7-day dialogue on building software in the age of AI. [Start from Day 1](/ai-dialogue-day-1-why-not-better-ai) or [read Day 2](/ai-dialogue-day-2-compliance-or-transfer).*

Yesterday's question: how do you keep the friction generative instead of destructive?

The answer is simpler than I expected.

Goals.

The same way we avoid scope creep. The same way we wrap up endless discussions. The same way decisions should be made.

By focusing on outcomes.

If goals and outcomes are well defined, anyone can make an argument that points toward the goal. The path becomes clear, no matter the ego.

The goal becomes the third party in the room. The impartial judge.

If we both agree we're trying to "ship this feature without coupling to the payment module," then my preference for interface segregation and your preference for a simpler function call can be evaluated against *that*. Not against each other's egos.

This also explains why most teams *don't* work this way.

Their goals are vague. "Build the thing." "Make it good." "Don't break anything."

When the goal is fuzzy, ego fills the vacuum. The argument becomes about who's right because there's nothing else to orient toward.

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"Goals work when they're stable. 'Deploy without downtime.' Clear. Evaluable. But what about early-stage product? Ambiguous requirements? When the business doesn't know what it wants yet?"*

*"The goal can't be the judge if the goal keeps moving."*

That's tomorrow's question.

What anchors the conversation when the destination itself is unclear?

Yours,
Ed
