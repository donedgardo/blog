The software industry requires a high level of professionalism. However, as a developer, there are attitudes and actions that you
should avoid to become a professional. This article shares tips for developers who want to improve their professionalism.
It highlights the top ten unprofessional developers' actions and how to avoid them.

Firstly, avoid committing to work that you cannot guarantee. Developers often agree to meet deadlines under pressure,
which may lead to taking shortcuts and compromising the quality of the work. Therefore, it's essential to learn when to say
no and only commit to tasks you can guarantee.

Secondly, protect your time and focus. If a meeting does not require your immediate participation, politely decline or
excuse yourself. Software development requires significant focus and concentration, which are not infinite
resources. So pace yourself, prioritize sleep, and know when to walk away.

Thirdly, avoid abandoning disciplines under pressure. Unprofessional developers leave their code as-is after making it
work. The best advice is to keep refactoring while practicing TDD (Test Driven Development). Please do not abandon your
disciplines; rely on them even more under pressure.

Fourthly, estimating work without giving a range is unprofessional. Managers will get false hopes when you give just one
number. Hope kills projects. Therefore, always communicate estimations as a range and agree on a backup plan.

Fifthly, don't hold yourself unaccountable for shipping bugs. Developers should take responsibility for the bugs in
their code and strive to reduce the error rate. It is unprofessional to assume that QA will catch all bugs. Automated
tests for your code are crucial to ensure its quality.

Sixthly, avoid tunnel visioning or "the zone" while coding. While "the zone" can increase productivity, developers often
lose sight of the big picture. Take a break, walk, or pair program with someone else when you notice yourself
slipping into "the zone" while coding.

Seventhly, start work with a clear goal or definition of what is done. A well-written story with a clear goal helps resolve
arguments and ensures that the team understands the situation.

Eighthly, deliver on time. Manage lateness and report it as soon as possible and with transparency.

Lastly, collaborate with the team. Unprofessional developers take it personally when another person critiques their work.
Professionals know that collaboration helps improve the quality of the work.

In conclusion, professionalism is crucial in the software industry. Avoiding unprofessional attitudes and actions is
essential to becoming a more professional developer.
