Hi, I've been in the software industry for almost a decade, and Uncle Bob's words have deeply resonated as I've experienced unprofessionalism throughout my career. Although I encountered unprofessionalism with peers and managers, I've also made some of these mistakes in my career. 

I believe this is because most developers don't profess anything in particular. Like doctors, we need to have a set of disciplines and attitudes that we can rely on to avoid regulations. Unfortunately, I don't think the world has caught up to the concept that we are writing the rules that will operate the coming generations. When the unimaginable happens. When many lives are lost because of unprofessionalism, the government will have to do its best and regulate. 

These are the top 10 attitudes and actions that professional developers overlook.

### 1.Committing to work you can't guarantee.

Unprofessional developers buckle under pressure and agree to try to meet a deadline. 
They could agree because they are optimistic, and you should never estimate in a hopeful state. 
As a result, they will take shortcuts and abandon disciplines, resulting in shortcomings in their work.

"Could you at least try?" said the manager. Conforming to try is agreeing that you aren't trying,
and even worse, the team will believe you are committing to deliver when you do.
When you underdeliver, they will think of you as untrustworthy.

Learn **when to say no** and **only commit to things you can guarantee**. 

### 2.Holding themselves unaccountable for shipping bugs.

"Are you saying the product has to be perfect without bugs?"
No, but it doesn't mean that we aren't responsible for them. The attitude that drives the unprofessional is "QA will
catch bugs," whereas a professional developer attitude says "QA will find nothing!". 
The human body is too complex to understand, but doctors take an oath not to harm. Why shouldn't we?  

Not having a set of automated tests for your code is unprofessional. You must know it works, and having automated tests
is a discipline that helps immensely. But most importantly:

Learn to **apologize** and work towards **effectively decreasing your error rate**. 

### 3.Abandoning disciplines under pressure. 

The phrase quick and dirty is an oxymoron.  The only way to go fast is to go well.

The best advice I can give is to avoid situations that cause pressure (see committing to things you can't guarantee).
But when the pressure finds you, it is even more important not to succumb to it.  Unprofessional leave their code as-is 
just after they make their code work. Making your code work is easy and hardly the end. Remember to keep refactoring 
while practicing TDD.

So **do not abandon your disciplines**; instead, **rely on them even more under pressure**.

### 4.Estimating work without giving a range.

Estimates should not be just one number; they should be a range (e.g., 2-6). Estimating with a range communicates the 
risks of unknowns. Do not encourage hope with your estimates. Managers will get false hopes when you give just one number.
Hope kills projects. 

It is easy to tie a shoe, but writing the instructions on how to tie a shoe for a computer that knows nothing about shoes
is entirely different.

Make sure your team understands the situation by communicating estimations as a range and agreeing on a backup plan. 

### 5.Not protecting your time and focus.

If you notice a meeting does not need your immediate participation or is unnecessary to a goal, you are working towards, 
politely decline it. If already in it, politely excuse yourself. Some meetings are necessary, like standup meetings,
iteration planning, and retrospectives. Software Development requires a significant amount of focus and concentration.
These are not infinite resources.

**You and you alone are responsible for protecting it**. Pace yourself, sleep is essential, and know when to walk away.



### 6.Tunnel visioning ("the zone") while coding.

The "zone" is a highly focused, tunnel-vision state of consciousness that programmers get into while writing code.
I know many developers who argue that they do their best code when in "the zone."  

I agree that they might write more code while in the zone, but they lose sight of the big picture.  In "the zone," I've
made many decisions that had to go back and change, or worst, thrown away. 

Of course, there are times I want to be in the zone, but that's only when I'm doing repeated tasks like practicing piano
scales but never solving a problem. Whenever I notice myself slipping into "the zone" while coding:

**Take a break** by taking a walk or **pair-program** with someone else. 

### 7.Starting work without a clear goal or definition of done.

My go-to solution for this is a well-written story. A well-written story has a specific user, a detailed description of
the feature, and a clear goal. The format is as "As a \<type of user\> I want \<detailed feature\>, so that \<clear goal\>." 
This is often not enoughâ€”a clear definition of "done" is needed instead. 

A clear goal also helps resolve arguments like "Can you make that a little bit bigger?" 
"Can you move it a little bit to the right?". You can quickly ground and resolve them by reminding the team of the goal.
Don't be passive-aggressive here and wait until the end to fill in the blanks.

### 8.Being late.

It happens to the best of us. Unprofessionalism comes about when you don't manage lateness, report it late, or without
transparency. 

The main reason professionals practice agile is to get the bad news quicker. So the sooner, the better, don't wait until the end! 

### 9.Not Collaborating with the team.

Unprofessional developers take it personally when another one critiques their code. Remember, you are not your code, 
don't take the feedback as an attack on your person. Instead, ask for peers for reviews, review your peers' code, or 
even better, pair-program. Take collective ownership of the code base, don't assign developers to a specific part of the
code; remember the bus rule.

Building software is a collaborative effort; you need to work with the business and each other.

### 10. Not Broadening their Horizons.

Employers often limit the languages and domains their programmers work on, resulting in an unhealthy narrowing of skillsets.
Unprofessional developers believe that their employers' job is to help them keep their skills sharp. 

**Learn new languages on your own time**, keep your skill sharp by practicing, and find yourself prepared for the changes
that periodically transform our industry.

Each year there is an increasing rate of developers than there was the previous year, resulting in a vast amount of inexperience in the field and very few experienced professionals. Hopefully, you find this helpful; if you did, please share it to advocate for more professionalism in software developers.
