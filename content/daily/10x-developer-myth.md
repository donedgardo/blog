title: "Moving Beyond the Reliance on Superstars in Tech"

I've recently started reading "The Phoenix Project." . This book tells a compelling fictional story.
It is about a tech organization struggling amidst chaos caused by common industry anti-patterns.

One pattern that stands out is the over-reliance on the "10x developer."
Many tech organizations harbor individuals around whom much of the activity seems to revolve.

While these developers are often seen as essential, they can, at times, hurt team performance if:

* They show little interest in sharing their knowledge.

* They prefer working by themselves instead of collaborating with their peers.

* They always say yes to requests. They never question whether they should.

These are all signs that the “10x dev” in question might be holding knowledge as power. 
They wedged themselves into every problem as a dependency. They now hold an irreplaceable position.
It is sad to see. They are people at the end of the day, and they may be doing this without knowing.

How do we, in positions of authority within the organization, change this attitude?

We cannot directly change people's attitudes, but we can change their day-to-day behaviors.
Behaviors like:

* Encouraging pair or ensemble programming over isolated work.

* Assigning team-shared goals over individual task assignments.

* Conducting blameless retrospectives to promote open communication and learning.

These behaviors will shift the attitude toward a more generative (goal-oriented) culture. 
High-performing teams avoid and discourage silos while fostering collaboration over individual performance.

What do you think? Have you seen similar patterns in your organization? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Yours,

Ed
