title: Agile Accountability Baseline

Fellow reader emailed me his contrarian view on Agile:

> "Agile is an excuse to avoid developer and customer accountability"

Interesting.

Before responding directly to this view we need to have a baseline of what Agile is, or meant to be.

A few years ago, I was an apprentice to Robert C. Martin, yes, Uncle Bob, the SOLID and Agile Manifesto guy.
Under their tutelage I got to experience what agile was really about. In today's age, people have turned and flipped
agile from its original meaning. Agile is now linked to process methods like Scrum and Kanban, and SAFe.

I've asked Bob about Agile and how he feels about all these new methodologies built around it. 
Well, he said he hated it. Most of the original authors of the Agile Manifesto feel like they lost control of the 
meaning of agile. The creators of agile wanted developers to rush to adopt its principles. Instead, project managers
rushed to get certified and enter a new role in software development.

I dislike that this new approach to Agile contradicts its first principle.

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

It seems that we have lost the essence of what agile was all about and flipped the priorities of every single principle agile stood for.

People nowadays view Agile as an adjective for methodology to go fast, but that is not what Agile is.

Agile is about getting feedback quicker.

Agile was a direct response to Waterfall. In Waterfall, teams spent months planning and years developing. At the end, they delivered the product without any feedback.

If I were to break down the core parts of agile:

- *Collaboratively plan and decide what to work on.*

- *Work together in small, incremental steps.*

- *Gather feedback on each small step.*

- *Retrospectively look back and improve based on feedback.*

All the disciplines I teach include these core parts: Test Driven Development, Refactoring, Pair Programming,
Learning Hours, etc.

So, let's break this one down:  **"...excuse to avoid developer accountability"**.

I don't see how agile reduces developers accountability. Developers and stakeholders agree on what to deliver in the
current iteration (e.g., 1 week; shorter is better). After completing the iteration, the team is accountable for not 
only delivering what they agreed on, but also ensuring its quality. So I can't agree with this view point.

I could agree on it if managers were setting the timelines for deliverables instead of the other way around 
(which would be a huge mistake). In that case, yeah, developers didn't have any accountability there.

Now, **"...excuse to avoid customer accountability"**.

In true agile fashion (really more XP; extreme programming), the team is working alongside the customer. 
When this happens, requirements and feedback feed each planning phase of each iteration. So again, I can't agree with 
customers not having accountability. If the team never interacts with the customer, then, yes, customers share no 
accountability. But, that would be a big mistake.

I hope this gives you a fresh view on agile. If I misunderstood, please reply. 
I'd love to discuss this more (obviously, look at how long this email got :D).  

Yours,

Ed

(PS: Accountability can't be given, it must be taken.)
