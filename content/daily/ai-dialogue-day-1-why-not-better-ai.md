title: "AI Dialogue Day 1: Why Not a Better AI?"

👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 1 of a 7-day dialogue on building software in the age of AI.*

---

After my last email about pairing in the AI era, a reader pushed back:

*"If judgment is the bottleneck, why add another human? Wouldn't a better AI, one trained on architecture decisions, solve this faster than hiring a second dev?"*

Fair question. And honestly? AI *does* review code better than it generates it.

But here's the problem.

AI is like an inexperienced developer who just finished reading the Gang of Four book. It knows the patterns. It will *use* the patterns. It will abstract when abstraction isn't needed, making something simple complex just for the sake of implementing a design pattern it recognized.

As seasoned developers, we don't have a crystal ball. We can't predict where changes will come from. Business requirements shift constantly.

But we understand context.

We understand the domain. We understand the user's pain points. We've developed intuition for *where* changes are likely to come and *in what form*.

Dependency injection? Clean architecture? These have tradeoffs. They add indirection. And indirection for the sake of "clean code" makes code harder to follow. Harder to change.

AI pattern-matches. Humans contextualize.

That's not a gap a better model closes. That's a gap lived experience closes.

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"You're describing taste. The ability to sense 'this abstraction isn't worth it yet.' But taste was built through years of pain. If the principled witness says 'don't do that,' does the prompter actually learn why? Or do they just comply?"*

---

That's tomorrow's question.

Is wisdom actually transferring in these moments? Or have we just built faster guardrails?

Yours,
Ed
