👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 4 of a 7-day dialogue on building software in the age of AI. [Start from Day 1](/daily/ai-dialogue-day-1-why-not-better-ai) or [read Day 3](/daily/ai-dialogue-day-3-third-party-in-the-room).*

Yesterday's question: what anchors the conversation when the destination is unclear?

If we're in the fog of ambiguous goals, the missing key is asking *why*.

Taking on work without knowing what success looks like (or sometimes, what failure looks like) is setting yourself and the team up for failure.

We ask:

Why are we doing this?
Why now?
Why not X or Y?
Why us?
Why me?

Keep digging into these questions.

They're hard. They might seem like you don't want to do the work. But they're necessary to understand if you're even capable of delivering the desired outcomes.

Not one line of code should start without a clear understanding of the whys.

The first job isn't writing code. It's earning the right to write code.

And the principled witness? They're not just watching architecture. They might be the one who stops the keyboard entirely and says: "Wait. Do we actually know what we're building? Or are we just moving to feel productive?"

That's uncomfortable. It looks like resistance. It *feels* like slowing down when everyone wants to go fast.

But it's the opposite of waste. Every line written toward a foggy goal is a line that might need to be deleted when clarity arrives.

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"But businesses aren't always honest. Sometimes the real answer to 'why this?' is 'because the VP promised it to a client' or 'because we need to look busy for the board.' The whys exist. They're just not the whys anyone will say out loud."*

*"What do you do when the answers are political, not principled?"*

That's tomorrow's question.

How do you navigate the gap between the stated goals and the real ones?

Yours,
Ed
