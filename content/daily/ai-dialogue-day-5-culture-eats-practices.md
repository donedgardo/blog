👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 5 of a 7-day dialogue on building software in the age of AI. [Start from Day 1](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/ai-dialogue-day-1-why-not-better-ai) or [read Day 4](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/ai-dialogue-day-4-ask-the-whys).*

Yesterday's question: what do you do when the answers are political, not principled?

Here's the uncomfortable truth.

When stated goals are superficial, like "making the board happy," you cannot responsibly commit to those uncontrollable outcomes.

Organizational dysfunction and political dynamics are not result oriented.

In this case, we're dealing with a bureaucratic organization vs a generative one.

This problem isn't fixed by AI or technical prowess. It's a culture issue. An attitude problem.

And we as individuals can't change attitudes directly.

But as leaders, what we *can* do is change daily behaviors. Behaviors that lead to undisputed, measurable outcomes. Outcomes that in turn change the attitudes.

Behaviors like:
- Ensemble programming
- Continuous integration
- Measuring outcomes instead of outputs
- Reflecting on work
- Adapting based on what we learn

All the practices the original Agile Manifesto and XP advocate.

This is how you change the organization from the inside. Start with the practices. Treat things like experiments. Measure outcomes. Focus on outcomes.

Behaviors first. Attitudes follow.

The Trojan horse: you sell them "faster delivery" and smuggle in "functional team dynamics."

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"This requires a leader willing to shield the team from the dysfunction above while new behaviors take root. Someone who absorbs the political pressure so the team can focus on outcomes."*

*"What happens when that leader doesn't exist? Can the practices survive without a protector?"*

That's tomorrow's question.

Can a team build this culture from the bottom up? Or does it require air cover from above?

Yours,
Ed
