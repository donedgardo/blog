👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 6 of a 7-day dialogue on building software in the age of AI. [Start from Day 1](/daily/ai-dialogue-day-1-why-not-better-ai) or [read Day 5](/daily/ai-dialogue-day-5-culture-eats-practices).*

Yesterday's question: can a team build this culture from the bottom up? Or does it require air cover from above?

Honestly? I don't know for certain.

But in my experience, it requires a sponsor. Someone who calls the shots or can influence higher up to create a truly functional team.

It's moot to have all these behavior and attitude shifts in a siloed team while the rest of the organization exists in daily bureaucratic (or worse, pathological) cultures.

Agility has been put in a box with engineering teams. The rest of the organization operates differently. That doesn't work.

It is truly a rare sight these days. But I've personally seen amazing teams that make me believe these aren't just dreams.

Here's what I've learned:

It starts from the bottom up. But it doesn't end there. It needs organizational support from higher up to truly work.

You need a sponsor or leader who shares this vision. Or at the very least, someone who notices the palpable outcomes of maybe a rebellious team that delivers above and beyond. Someone who decides "we want whatever they are doing."

The practices create the proof. The sponsor creates the permission.

Without the sponsor, you get a great team that eventually burns out fighting the current. Or gets disbanded when reorg season comes. Or watches their practices erode as "business priorities" demand they stop "wasting time" on pairing.

The dream is real. I've seen it. But it's fragile without air cover.

**Tomorrow: the wrap-up.**

We started with a technical question: how do you code with AI responsibly?

We ended somewhere deeper: how do you build teams that can handle the judgment AI can't provide?

Yours,
Ed
