👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 7, the final day of a 7-day dialogue on building software in the age of AI. [Start from Day 1](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/ai-dialogue-day-1-why-not-better-ai) or [read Day 6](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/ai-dialogue-day-6-the-sponsor-question).*

Let's zoom out.

We started with a technical question: AI generates code faster than ever. What's the new bottleneck?

Judgment.

So we explored what judgment requires. Not a better AI. A second human. Someone to ask "should it work this way?" while the first asks "does it work?"

But that raised a harder question: does wisdom actually transfer in those moments? Or is it just compliance?

The answer: roles aren't fixed. Prompter becomes witness. Witness takes the keyboard. Wisdom emerges from the friction, not from one person's authority.

Then: what keeps that friction generative instead of destructive?

Goals. Clear outcomes. The goal becomes the third party in the room. The impartial judge that ego can't argue with.

But what about when goals are foggy?

Ask the whys. Earn the right to write code before writing it. The principled witness might stop the keyboard entirely: "Do we know what we're building?"

And when the whys reveal politics instead of principles?

You've hit the boundary. Technical practices can't fix a culture that doesn't want to be fixed.

But they can *build* culture in an organization that's open to it. Behaviors first. Attitudes follow.

And for that to scale beyond one rebellious team?

You need a sponsor. Someone who notices the outcomes and creates permission for the practices to spread.

**The through-line:**

We thought we were talking about coding with AI.

We were actually talking about building teams. About creating the conditions where human judgment can thrive alongside machine speed.

The answer isn't a tool or a framework.

It's behaviors, practiced daily, protected by someone who believes outcomes matter more than optics.

That's the work.

Yours,
Ed
