Is your team goal aligned with your organization's goals?

Here's a great exercise to find out:

Ask your team members what the current goals are.

Are they the same as yours?

If they are, then great.

If not, it will benefit the organization to communicate your current goals clearly.

Also make sure it's visible to everyone on the team.

Yours,

Ed
