title: "Purpose-Driven Development: Avoiding Scope Creep in SaaS Projects"
category: daily
---
I've often seen developers over-engineer solutions, ending up with unnecessary code.

A simple feature can quickly balloon into a lengthy list of nice-to-haves.

As a SaaS founder, how can we avoid falling into the trap of scope creep?

* **Communicate Purpose Over Process**: Avoid giving developers a detailed step-by-step feature list. This can deprive them of purpose and stifle their creativity. Instead, focus on communicating the "why" behind the project.


* **Define Success Clearly**: Clarify how you'll recognize success. Finish this sentence: "We'll know we've done an amazing job when ______." This sets clear goals without being prescriptive about how to achieve them.


* **Empower Creativity**: Trust your developers with the implementation details. Exploring solutions encourages innovation. It can lead to better, simple solutions that fit your current architecture.


By fostering a culture of purpose and autonomy, you'll not only prevent scope creep but also enhance developer satisfaction and innovation.

Yours,

Ed
