What's the best process and tools for software development?

The ones your team chooses.

As leaders, it is tempting to dictate the tools and processes you believe are best for the team.

After all, consistency and control seem like pathways to efficiency.

But here's a thoughtâ€”what if giving your team these decisions could boost performance?

Research and experience show that the best teams are trusted and autonomous.

Let your teams act, make decisions, and then reflect.

Action comes before reflection.

This cycle of doing and evaluating builds both skills and team spirit.

Teams that choose their tools and processes are more engaged.

All while delivering better results.

They become stakeholders in their destiny, and accountability emerges as a consequence.

Empower your team today, and unlock their full potential.

Yours,

Ed
