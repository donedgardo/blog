How do we get better at estimating software deliverables?

Well, by not doing them.

Stop making your developers waste time on guessing games.

Anything that stands in the way of delivering value to customers is wasteful.

Estimation = guessing = wasteful.

Sure, there are business reasons for these estimates, like for budget allocation, cross-department planning, and deciding if the work is worth the cost.

Yet, there is a better way to forecast a software deliverable's availability that is better than wasting dev time on guessing games.

Have the software team break the deliverable into smaller, solvable problems. They have to do this anyway. It's part of being a skilled engineer. 

Each week, count how many of these stories/tasks you have completed. Now you have a rate of sorties/tasks done per week.

Now here's how business can answer the dreaded “when will this be done?” question. When someone requests a software deliverable, have the team break it down into smaller stories.

Multiply the number of stories by your weekly completion rate.

Example: The team finishes three stories per week. The team breaks down a feature into six stories. Then we forecast the deliverable to be done in two weeks.

Tada! No more waste!

Now please stop wasting time playing guessing games.

Yours,

Ed
