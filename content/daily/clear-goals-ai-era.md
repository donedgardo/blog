Hello there! 👋

Welcome to the team. Over the next few days, I'll share the principles that have transformed every dev team I've worked with.

These ideas aren't new. But they've never mattered more than right now.

We're living through a shift. AI agents write code now. Tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Claude can generate features in minutes that used to take days. The bottleneck isn't typing anymore.

So what is?

**Clarity.**

Here's a question I ask every team I coach:

*"How will you know if you did a good job?"*

Simple, right? But watch what happens when you ask it. Blank stares. Nervous laughter. "Well, the ticket said..."

That's the problem. Teams ship features without knowing what success looks like. They hit deadlines but miss outcomes. They're busy, but are they effective?

And here's the thing: **AI makes this worse, not better.**

When generating code is instant, you can build the wrong thing faster than ever. Speed without direction is just faster chaos.

**The fix is embarrassingly simple.**

Before starting any work — before prompting any AI — answer four questions:

1. Why are we doing this?
2. Why now?
3. How will we know if we did a good job?
4. What would "exceeding expectations" look like?

That's it. No frameworks. No certifications. Just clarity.

When your team knows what "done" actually means, something shifts. They stop gold-plating features nobody asked for. They start making decisions without waiting for permission. They move faster *because* they have constraints, not despite them.

To go fast, you have to go well. And "well" starts with knowing where you're going.

Tomorrow, I'll show you how to get your whole team aligned on outcomes before writing a single line of code — human or AI-generated.

Yours,
Ed
