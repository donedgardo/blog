Here are some successful experiments from my years of coaching.

Try eliminating these:

* Lengthy and manual QA processes.

* Code review committees blocking integration.

* Detailed specification documentation with extensive information.

Instead, try:

* Suggest dev teams write failing automated tests before making them pass through implementation.

* Encourage the dev team to pair up while coding and continuously integrate.

* Write enough of the specification to start the work. Don't explain how to finish it. Answer the why of doing X.

Try these out and let me know how it went.

If it went well, continue doing them.

If it didn't, that's fine too; reflect on why and let your team decide the best way forward.

Yours,

Ed
