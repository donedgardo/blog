title: "Is Your Software Team Missing This Crucial Element?"
category: daily
---
It doesn’t matter how fast you release features or fix bugs if your customers aren’t in the loop.

If they aren’t coming through the door to talk to your team, then what's truly being achieved?

Our customer's voices are indispensable. Bring them into the conversation, and you'll not just deliver software—you'll deliver exactly what they need.

Let’s challenge the status quo and make customer collaboration a core part of your development journey.

Yours,

Ed
