title: "Unlock Success: Let Your Customers Lead the Way"
category: daily

In my experience, SaaS fails most often due to building things that our customers
don't care about. It's a hard truth, but an important one.

Here's the tale we've all seen: Founders, eager to create the next big thing,
often assume the voice of their customers based on hunches and guesswork. 
It's understandableâ€”we know our product is great. But do our customers?

So, how do you flip the script?

* **Give Customers a Voice**: Your customers are your guiding stars.
Invite them into the product development process early and often, ensuring their voices shape your decisions.

* **Validate Before You Invest**: Test early, test often.
Use low-fidelity mocks to showcase ideas before committing resources.
It saves not just time and money but captures real-time insights that ensure your product hits the mark.

Let your customers' feedback steer you toward delivering meaningful value.
Miss out on this, and you could be missing market share along with it.

Try these approaches. See how they improve your team's alignment with customer needs. 
If they work, keep them. If not, reflect and let your team determine the best way forward.

Challenge the status quo and discover a more productive path.

Yours,

Ed
