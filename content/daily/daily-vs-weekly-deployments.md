title: "Deploying Daily Vs. Weekly."
category: daily
---

When a software team is deploying weekly or monthly, changes pile up and many things can go wrong.

Bugs are harder to triage and fix.

Feedback is delayed, increasing the risk that we are building the wrong thing.Â 

When a team is deploying daily, changes are small.

Bugs are easy to detect and fix.

We deliver value quickly to end users.

Feedback is quicker. This lets us adapt to change with a low upfront investment.

Try it; you can thank me later. :)

Yours,

Ed
