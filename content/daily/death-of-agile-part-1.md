title: The Death of Agile? 
category: daily
---
A fellow reader sent me this thought-provoking question:

> "I think the argument against agile is that almost everyone is doing it wrong. If a framework is so difficult to implement that virtually everyone does it wrong, wouldn't it start to make you question the framework?"

Yes, it would, and I do question these "agile" frameworks on a daily basis. Because all of them invert the values agile stands for. Yet, agile is not a framework. Most people conflate it with a framework. Looking at you, Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, etc.

### Agile is a set of values and principles:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation.

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiations.

**Responding to change** over following a plan.

-----

The first principle rejects all these frameworks. They are all processes and do not represent these principles and values.

In Scrum, a Product Owner represents the customer. But, in true agile fashion, an actual customer collaborates directly with the team.

In SAFe, only the development team follows Scrum. The rest of the organization is bogged down by bureaucracy. It creates friction that hinders the response to change.

The practices exist because of the principles. The principles exist because of the values. Not the other way around.

There is this notion of fake agility that's suitable for corporations but doesn't work in the real world.

In tomorrow's email, we will explore why this is.

Yours,
