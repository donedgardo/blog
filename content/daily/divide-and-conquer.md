title: "Mastering Team Focus: The True Power of Divide and Conquer"
category: daily
---
Recently, a client suggested using "divide and conquer" by splitting the team to handle multiple tasks at once.

However, in its original context from The Art of War, "divide and conquer" meant to divide the enemy, not the army.

In software development terms, it means breaking a challenge into smaller tasks. Then, the team works together to solve them.

High-performing teams focus on one valuable item at a timeâ€”united in their effort.

Remember:

Limit work in progress to maximize productivity and achieve quality results.

Yours,

Ed
