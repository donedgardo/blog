In yesterday's edition, we discussed the benefits of this collaborative approach called Ensemble Programming.

Today, let's explore how to run an effective ensemble programming session.

Let's ensure that your team gets the most out of it.

### Steps for Running an Effective Ensemble Programming Session

#### Set clear goals and prepare:

Before starting, define clear goals for what your team aims to achieve. This could be new code, improving existing code, or a detailed refactor. Pick a task the team will work on. It must involve writing or improving code that delivers customer value.

#### Define Roles:

- Navigator: Leads the work and explains what needs to be done.

- Typist: Types the code as per the navigator’s guidance.

- Co-navigators: Other team members support the navigator with suggestions. They ensure the group maintains a coherent direction.

#### Follow a rotation pattern:

Use timers to rotate roles at regular intervals (e.g., 10-15 min). This keeps everyone engaged and ensures the dissemination of knowledge across team members. You can build or adopt a timer tool that suits your team’s needs, indicating whose turn it is to navigate or type.

#### Choose a facilitator:

Assigned facilitators help keep the session running smoothly. They remind people of the working agreements and ensure smooth role rotations. As your team gains experience, the need for active facilitation might lessen.

#### Emphasize communication and learning:

Encourage open communication. Make it a norm that if anyone does not understand something, they should ask questions. This keeps everyone aligned and improves our shared knowledge.

#### Handle Remote Sessions with Care:

Ensure everyone can see each other’s faces as well as the code. Be more considerate with comments. Take regular breaks. Ensure the typist does not lag due to keypresses or mouse movements. Use additional tools like virtual whiteboards for sketches and retrospectives.

#### Choose Your Moments to Speak:

Timing your comments properly in a remote setting is crucial to avoid talking over each other. Consider using 'raise hand' features or chat comments in video calls to minimize disruptions.

#### Limit Session Duration:

For teams new to ensemble programming, limit sessions to 2 hours. This prevents fatigue and keeps the session productive.

Ensemble programming fosters strong collaboration and understanding within a team.

By emphasizing role rotations, effective facilitation, and thoughtful task selection, teams can leverage their collective intelligence. This will improve their productivity and code quality.
