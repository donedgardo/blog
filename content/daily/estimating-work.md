title: Why You Should Stop Asking Engineers for Estimates Immediately

Stop asking engineers to estimate the work.

Instead of wanting a good guess of when something might be completed, do this instead.

Ask the team to break the stories into small units of work.

This could be a series of tasks that deliver some value or a step toward the completion of work.

Each story/task is worth one point.

Measure how many stories your team gets done in your iterations.

Once you have this frequency rate, you can better estimate your throughput.

To predict a story's time to complete, have the team break it into smaller ones. Then divide that by your throughput.

This calculates the number of iterations under ideal conditions.

But not everything goes well, so always have a backup plan.
