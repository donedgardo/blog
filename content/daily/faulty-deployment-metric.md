title: "Deploy Smarter, Not Just Faster: Cut Down Faulty Releases Today"
category: daily
---

In our last email, we discussed how increasing your deployment frequency can lead to greater success in the market.

However, that's only part of the story.

Deployments won't ensure success if they cause more bugs and system failures.

Today, we focus on the critical metric of faulty deployment rates:

**How many of your releases are introducing bugs or causing system failures?**

### Key Points:

- **Track Faulty Deployment Rates**: If a high percentage of your releases lead to bugs or failures, prioritize fixing these issues over adding new features. Fixing bugs quickly is cheaper and more efficient than fixing them later.

- **Rapid Response**: High-frequency releases mean smaller changes, making it easier to identify and fix issues quickly. Fresh problems are simpler to resolve as they are still in the developerâ€™s mind.

- **Integrated Quality**: High performers:
  - Build quality into their processes.
  - Enable rapid and reliable deployments.

Low performers often try to go faster. They don't invest in quality. This leads to many deployment failures and longer recovery times.

### Practical Steps:

- **Use Ticketing Systems**: A simple ticketing system can track and manage issues as they arise.

- **Invest in Quality**: Focus on building quality into every step of the deployment process, including:
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
  - Automated testing.
  - Environment consistency.

*Focus not just on deployment frequency but also on reliability. This will keep your speed and stability, and boost performance.*

Yours,

Ed
