title: "Why Deployment Frequency is the Key to Outpacing Your Competitors"
category: daily
---
*Company A is losing market share while putting out fires on a daily basis.
Company B is delivering features daily to happy customers.*

The main difference? Deployment frequency.

In today's fast-paced tech world, the frequency of your releases can make or break your company's success. 
Let's consider the stories of two companies:

---
Company A says: "Let's not deploy until our QA committee has approved the feature."

Company B says: "Let's deploy; the feature is passing our automated acceptance tests."

---

Company A says: "Let's hold off until our Expert Code Committee approves the code changes."

Company B says: "Let's deploy; I've pair-programmed with Bob on this; there's no need for a review."

---

Company A says: "Let's not deploy until we have all these other features."

Company B says: "Let's deploy these small changes; we can release those other things later."

### Which company do you think will outperform the other? Why?

**Why Company B Will Win**

- **Speed**: Frequent deployments mean quicker feedback and faster resolution of issues.

- **Efficiency**: Automated tests and pair programming streamline the deployment process.

- **Customer Satisfaction**: Regular updates keep customers engaged and satisfied with continuous improvements.

Align your processes with Company B to accelerate your growth and stay ahead of the competition.

Yours,

Ed
