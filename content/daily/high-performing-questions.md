title: "ðŸš€ Is Your Software Team Truly High-Performing? Letâ€™s Find Out!"
category: daily

How do you know if your software team is performing well?

This is one of the first questions I ask executives. The typical answer?

**"Delivering on schedule."**

But that begs the question: Whose schedule?

Let's dig a bit deeper. Here are a few critical questions to determine if your team is a low or high performer:

1. **Customer Requests**: How long does it take to deliver a customer request?
2. **Update Frequency**: How frequently do you deliver updates to end users?
3. **Quality of Deployments**: What percentage of your deployments are faulty or introduce bugs?
4. **Recovery Time**: What is your mean time to restore faulty deployments?

Feel free to **reply with your answers**. Weâ€™ll be exploring each of these metrics in future emails.

Stay tuned for more!

Yours,

Ed
