You know how many software teams struggle with inefficiencies, high defect rates, and poor communication, often misaligning their development work with business goals?

Well, I wanted to share some insights on a crucial metric that could significantly transform these challenges: lead times.

### What is Lead Time?

In lean software and DevOps, "lead time" is the time from a request to its fulfillment. In software delivery, it is the time from when new code is committed until it is running successfully in production.

### Why Lead Times Matter

- **Feedback Speed**: Shorter lead times enable quicker feedback on new features. This allows for rapid adjustments and keeps your development agile.

- **Defect Resolution**: When defects or outages occur, quick fixes are critical. They reduce downtime and maintain customer satisfaction.

- **Product Delivery Efficiency**: Efficient lead times provide a competitive advantage. High-performing tech firms often deploy code and maintain quick lead times. This sets them apart from the competition.

### How to Measure Lead Times

Effective measurement is simple and outcome-focused. Lead times can be segmented into:

- **Code Commit to Production**: Time from code commitment to live production.

- **Design to Delivery**: Time encompassing both feature design/validation and delivery to customers.

Also, lead times can be categorized by specific intervals. This helps teams analyze and optimize their processes.

Using small batches in work improves lead times. It allows for rapid development and frequent releases.

### Conclusion

Lead times are key to an agile, responsive, and efficient team. Measuring lead times well gives your organization a competitive edge in tech.
