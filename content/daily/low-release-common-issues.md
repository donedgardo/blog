title: "Common Issues and Antipatterns for Low Deployment Frequency"
category: daily
---

Here are some common reasons for low deployment frequency:

1. **Fear**: A lack of confidence that code changes will not cause breakage or outages.

2. **Complex Integrations**: Changes in code accumulate, making it challenging to integrate and ensure compatibility across all changes.

3. **High-Stress Deployments**: Deployments need much coordination and manual work. This stresses the team and stakeholders.

4. **Time-Consuming Reviews**: Committees like QA take a long time to review each change or potential change.

### Solutions:

#### 1. Increase Confidence with Automated Testing:

- Invest in test-driven development (TDD) and refactoring training.

- Improve your team's craftsmanship by building quality from the start. These skills allow your developers to write code that is easy to maintain and change.

#### 2. Adopt Continuous Integration (CI):

- Integrate often and early. Continuous integration leads to more frequent and less risky integrations.

- Run your automated tests to get instant feedback on new code. This allows for quick feedback and boosts developer confidence.

#### 3. Simplify and Increase Deployment Frequency:

- If deployments are painful, do them more often. Bring the pain forward, and force yourself to ease those pain points.

- Invest in internal tooling to streamline the deployment workflow. Aim for a process as simple as selecting an environment and clicking a button.

#### 4. Empower Teams to Make Decisions:

- Cut decision-making committees like QA, code review, or tool selection boards. Trust your team to make the decisions that have a direct impact on their work.

- Self-organized teams should handle their own processes, tool choices, and key decisions.
