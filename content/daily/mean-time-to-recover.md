title: "The Secret to High-Performance System Recovery"
category: daily
---

So we covered high deployment frequency and low faulty deployment rates.

Yet, bugs are inevitable, and system failures will happen.

When this happens, what matters is how fast we recover our systems.

This is when measuring mean time to recovery (MTTR) matters.

***How quickly can your team restore service after a failure?***

Low performers take 170 times slower to restore faulty systems than high-performing teams.

How do we achieve this?

Well, investing in the quality and efficiency of our software continuous delivery  system.

High-performing teams can rollback systems to healthy states in under 5 minutes.

Just by clicking one button.

Does your team have that ability?

Yours,

Ed
