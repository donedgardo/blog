In case you missed it, our last email discussed why time estimates are hard in software development.

### Are story points a better alternative?

So what about story points?

Most agile frameworks ask teams to break down stories into smaller chunks. As per our example, these might be:

- Teaching the person about shoes.
- Teaching about laces.
- Teaching enough about physics.
- Teaching steps on how to tie shoes.

In most frameworks, teams then assign some arbitrary points based on effort.
The higher the points, the more effort is required. This is easier for teams to do instead of giving time estimates.
Teams then work and notice they get 15 points done per week.
So if a story is 5 points, the team can have an educated guess that it will take approximately 2 days.

Yet, anything that impedes delivering value to customers is waste.

**So this estimation game is also waste.**

That raises a question.

### How can we predict a story's completion without making estimates?

Simple.

Make sure stories are small; divide them if they arenâ€™t.

Skip the estimation game.

Sum up the number of stories done in a week.

This will be your weekly throughput.

If a high-effort story gets split into ten smaller ones, and your team's throughput is five stories a week, then you can guess it will take two weeks.

Remember,

*Anything that impedes delivering value to customers is waste.*
