title: "Accelerating Developer Onboarding: Ditch the Docs and Embrace Collaborative Coding"
category: daily
---
Onboarding new developers shouldn't feel like navigating a maze. 
Yet, I've seen companies where it takes three months for a new hire to contribute.
I helped a client cut this down to two weeks. I did it not by using old docs, but by fostering team interaction.

Why skip the docs? Here's the catch:

* **Documentation can quickly become a relic.** Sure, maintaining it sounds feasible, but it's a never-ending task.
The real goal should be knowledge transfer in a dynamic, engaging way.

* **Context is king.** Static documents rarely deliver the context required to tackle real-world challenges.

* **Information overload.** Faced with a sea of documents, how does a newcomer identify what's pertinent?

Here's how we transformed onboarding:

* **Prioritize personal interaction over reading materials.**
Documentation should support, not dictate, the onboarding process. Efficient comms trump stale paper trails.
 

* **Ensemble Programming: The Orchestra of Seamless Integration.** 
Ensemble programming revolutionizes how teams onboard new developers.
Instead of passive learning, new developers engage in coding alongside experienced team members.
The experienced guide the ensemble in conducting a symphony of shared knowledge, while new hires rotate 
as the 'typist'â€”ensuring no one is left out of the loop.


* **Experience over accumulation.** Joining an ensemble means a new developer becomes a contributor in minutes,
not months. They dive headfirst into the codebase, absorbing team norms and operational nuances faster than any
manual can teach.

Consider phasing out extensive documentation in favor of real-time collaboration and learning.
Leverage the power of ensemble programming to cut through the fluff and ensure your new hires hit the ground running.

Yours,

Ed
