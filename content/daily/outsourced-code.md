title: Outsourcing Software? Think again.

So you decided to offshore some critical software for your business… here is the thing.

Software built by an outside team only has one goal: to make it work.

Building software for the sake of making it work is easy.

Making software that is easy to change—now that is the hard part.

When software is just made to work, it assumes business requirements won't change. We are writing SOFTware, not HARDware.

Software is designed for change.

Outsourcing critical parts of the business to offshore developers hurts your business.

Once you receive the code, it will be a burden.

This code will be too complex, with duplicated code. Worst of all, it will lack tests.

Maintaining it seems daunting, but it is not impossible.

A good developer can help by refactoring, adding tests, and building on your legacy code.

But good developers are hard to find. It is easier to train them than to find them.

I've seen SaaS companies freeze because their codebase is too rigid. It's even fragile. I love Martin Fowler's analogy for this situation. He compares legacy code to strangle figs.

> These are vines that germinate in a nook of a tree. As it grows, it draws nutrients from the host tree until it reaches the ground to grow roots and the canopy to get sunlight. It can then become self-sustaining, and its original host tree may die leaving the fig as an echo of its shape. This gradual process of replacing the host tree struck me as a striking analogy to the way I saw colleagues doing modernization of legacy software systems.

Outsourcing software has "quick", cheap benefits.

But, cheap is expensive.

To go fast, you must go well.

Yours,
