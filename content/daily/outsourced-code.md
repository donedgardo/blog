title: Outsourcing Software? Think again.
category: daily

So you've decided to offshore some critical software for your business? Hereâ€™s the thing:

Software built by an outside team focuses mainly on making it work.

It's easy to build software that just works.

But making software that is easy to change? Now, that's the real challenge.

When software is merely made to work, it assumes business requirements won't change. Spoiler alert: They will. Remember, it's called SOFTware, not HARDware.

Software is designed to be adaptable.

Outsourcing critical parts to offshore developers can hurt your business. Once you receive the code, it becomes a burdenâ€”complex, filled with duplicated code, and often lacking proper tests.

Maintaining it might seem daunting, but it's not impossible.

A good developer can help by refactoring, adding tests, and building on your legacy code. But finding GOOD developers? Easier said than done.

In fact, it's often easier to train them than to find them.

Iâ€™ve seen SaaS companies freeze because their codebase is too rigid and fragile.

Martin Fowler's analogy fits perfectly here. He compares legacy code to strangler figs:

> These are vines that germinate in a nook of a tree. As it grows, it draws nutrients from the host tree until it reaches the ground to grow roots and the canopy to get sunlight. It can then become self-sustaining, and its original host tree may die leaving the fig as an echo of its shape. This gradual process of replacing the host tree struck me as a striking analogy to the way I saw colleagues doing modernization of legacy software systems."

Outsourcing software has "quick" and cheap benefits. But remember: cheap is expensive.

To go fast, you must go well. ðŸš€
