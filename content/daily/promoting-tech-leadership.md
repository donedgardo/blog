title: "Promote Leaders Your Team Wants to Follow"

Dear SaaS founders,

When promoting team members to tech leadership roles, let the team be the ones who decide.

Way too often, I see organizations promoting with only an outside perspective. When this happens, you likely promote based on likeness or individual performance.

I've met many self-serving, people-pleasing developers who either:

- Don't have the courage to tell you the hard truths.

- Don't ask good questions.

- Work in silos for "job safety."

But here is the thing: software development is a team sport. If the team dislikes working with this person, the promotion may hurt performance.

Yours,

Ed
