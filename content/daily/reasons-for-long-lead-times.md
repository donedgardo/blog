Lead time is the time from a customer's request to the delivery of their requirement.

Reducing the causes of long lead times will boost your team's performance and customer satisfaction.

### Here are some common pitfalls:

**Lack of Customer Involvement**

Not involving customers in development leads to solutions that don't meet their needs.

**Bureaucratic Culture**

A culture with too much red tape wastes time. 

Siloed departments prevent easy access to information.

**Committees blocking progress**

Committees, especially for code reviews, can create bottlenecks, causing idle time for engineers. 

These committees often make decisions that don't affect them. They are often detached from their decisions, the context, and the outcomes.

**Lack of automation in software delivery**

Without automation, software deployments can be slow and error-prone.


### Here are some strategies to overcome them:

- Engage customers early and often. Gather feedback at every stage to ensure you're on the right track.

- Foster open communication and collaboration across teams.

- Streamline approvals. Trust teams to decide and do the work.

- Invest in automation tools for your software delivery process.

Reducing lead times is not just about efficiency.
It's about delivering real value to your customers, faster and with confidence. Start implementing these strategies today and watch your team's performance soar.

Yours,

Ed
