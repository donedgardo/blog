title: "Why Fast Isn't Always Best in Software Delivery"
category: daily

Is delivering faster software what really sets you apart from your competition?

Many business leaders come to me asking to reduce their lead times.

When I ask why that's important to them, most tell me:

"Because we want to deliver software faster than our competitors."

But that's not the right answer.

Delivering software faster alone is rarely an obstacle to success.

What truly matters is that we deliver the **RIGHT** software solution faster than our competitors.

I remember a time when I worked for a software agency. Product owners would request changes based on their hunches about what consumers needed. We naively executed on every request; the aftermath? A product that no one needed or wanted.

To remediate this, ask yourself:

* Am I collaborating with our customers to understand their needs?

* Am I getting customer feedback on product decisions along the lifecycle of software delivery?

If the answer is no, then try the following:

1. Before development starts, sit down with your customers and ask them what they need to do.

2. The team builds 1 or 2 no-code prototypes. They share them with 1-5 customers to get feedback and ensure they meet their needs. Repeat until you do so. [Check out my micro guide on facilitating collaborative design sessions here.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/edgardo-carreras_facilitate-a-collaborative-design-session-activity-7219717581652271104-RfEP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

3. The team builds it and gives it to the customer for usability testing. No hand-holding here. Tell your customer to try to do what they need, and let them explore on their own. Watch them tumble or perform their tasks with ease. Write down your findings and iterate.

Put in place an open-door policy that allows customers to collaborate directly with your team.

Try opening a new channel for customer feedback this month.

You might be surprised at how it revolutionizes your product development.

Yours,

Ed
