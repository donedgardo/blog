Hello there! 👋

The days of typing code keystroke by keystroke are over.

I've been experimenting with agentic coding, letting AI agents write, test, and iterate alongside me. It's like having a genie. A cracked, caffeinated junior dev genie who works at extreme speeds.

But here's the thing about genies: they grant exactly what you ask for. Not what you meant. Not what you needed.

Speed doesn't mean anything if the destination is wrong.

So the principles matter more than ever. Not less.

**Ask the right question.** The genie will happily build the wrong thing at lightning speed. Clarity up front saves hours of unwinding later.

**Add quality gates early and often.** Write the test. Watch it fail. Watch it pass. That feedback loop is your steering wheel.

**Review and refactor constantly.** The genie doesn't feel the weight of maintaining what it wrote. You will. Clean it before you move on.

It's like steering a ship. The sea conditions change. Your tests, your feedback, your gut. You adjust course, little by little. You don't set the heading once and walk away.

Kent Beck put it perfectly: *"90% of our skills became obsolete, yet the remaining 10% 10x'd in value."*

That 10%? It's the steering. The judgment. The principles.

The genie types. You navigate.

To go fast, we have to go well. 😉

Yours,

Ed
