title: "Fix Your User Stories Now: Easy Steps to Real Value!"
category: daily
---
Here is a dysfunctional user story and what I would change to make it solid.

❌ "Create a backend endpoint so that we can create an invoice."

Stories describe your users' work, not your work.

So many times do I see teams creating stories like, "install dependency X", "write backend code", "write fronted code"... the list goes on. These are not stories; these are only implementation details.

Another mistake I see is how teams sometimes treat stories like in-depth documentation. Avoid writing all the scenarios and acceptance criteria for each edge case.

The story should have enough detail to start work on it, not to end it.

In an ideal scenario, customers are interacting with team members on a daily basis. Treat stories as placeholders for these conversations.

Here's how I would fix the story.

First, let's find the answer to who?

Avoid generic users; specify the user segment.

❌ "As an user ..."

✅ "As a retail client ..."

Now let's answer the question: what does the user want to do?

Don't fall into the trap of describing how:

❌ "... I want to see and click the invoice tab button in the web app..."

✅ "... I want to see an invoice from my previous orders..."

And most importantly, the why.  Focus on customer value.

Treat this as the core of your success criteria.

✅ "... so that I know how much I owe."

These steps will help your team deliver high-value, low-complexity work that satisfies customers.

Yours,

Ed
