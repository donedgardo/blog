title: Rethinking How You Structure Your Engineering Team
category: daily
---
How do you, as a CEO or CTO, structure your engineering team?

Well, you don't.

High-performing organizations let their teams choose whom to work with.

Most medium-small tech firm executives do most of the hiring and firing.

When executives or outsiders make these decisions, the new hire has a high chance of not fitting in.

Top teams collaborate non-stop. Like a sports team, they hold each other accountable. If one member is not vibing or meeting the team's standards, the team will not want to work with them.

Instead, do this.

Have the team do technical interviews that include pair programming with new prospects. This will assess their technical skills, attitudes, and most importantly, communication skills.

When looking for prospective new hires, make sure the final say comes from the team members.

When the final hiring decision comes from the team, you’ll notice improved dynamics, better solutions, faster delivery, and happier engineers.

Yours,

Ed
