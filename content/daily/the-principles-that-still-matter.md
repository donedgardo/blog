Hello there! 👋

If you're new here, welcome aboard. 

We're living through a shift in how software gets built. AI agents write code now. Agentic coding is real, it's fast, and it's changing everything.

Everything except the fundamentals.

The tools are new. The principles are not. In fact, they matter more than ever. Speed without direction is just faster chaos.

So for you newcomers, here's a curated tour of the ideas I keep coming back to. The foundation that makes the new stuff work.

---

**On Agile (The Real Kind)**

🎯 [The True Essence of Agile](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/true-essence-of-agile) — Agile is a culture, not a framework. It starts at the top.

💀 [The Death of Agile?](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/death-of-agile-part-1) — Why almost everyone does it wrong, and what agile actually stands for.

🚫 [Why Most Agile Implementations Fail](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/why-most-agile-implementations-fail) — Process is not a canned product. Flexibility is the point.

---

**On Speed (Done Right)**

⏱️ [Optimizing Lead Times](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/lead-times) — The metric that matters. From commit to production, faster.

🎯 [Why Fast Isn't Always Best](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/software-delivery-speed) — Delivering the *right* software faster is what wins.

🚀 [Deploy Smarter, Not Just Faster](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/faulty-deployment-metric) — Speed means nothing if every release breaks something.

---

**On Quality**

🧪 [Types of Automated Tests](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/types-of-tests) — Unit, integration, acceptance. Know your tools.

🛑 [The Executive Who Said Skip the Tests](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/skip-testing) — Spoiler: it didn't make them faster.

🔄 [From Chaos to Clarity: Continuous Delivery](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/ci-disaster-and-why-it-matters) — Why broken builds break everything.

---

**On Teams**

👥 [Harness the Power of Ensemble Programming](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/ensemble-programing-benefits) — Code together. Learn together. Ship together.

🏆 [Boost Performance with the Right Culture](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/high-performing-culture) — Pathological, bureaucratic, or generative. Which one are you?

🦸 [Moving Beyond the 10x Developer Myth](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/10x-developer-myth) — Superstars can hurt. Collaboration wins.

These principles aren't relics. They're the steering wheel.

The genie types. You navigate.

To go fast, we have to go well. 😉

Yours,

Ed
