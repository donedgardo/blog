title: "Transforming Deadline Pressure into Sustainable Success: A Developer's Dilemma"
category: daily
---
In the realm of software development, the balance between delivering on time and maintaining quality often feels like 
walking a tightrope. Today, I want to share some insights on how aggressively tying ourselves to deadlines can push our
teams towards counterproductive shortcuts, potentially jeopardizing both our projects and our people.

### Beyond Estimates: A Better Approach to Timelines

Experienced developers often advise against committing to strict estimates.
If you're unfamiliar, explore our approach on how to avoid fixed estimates and suggest more predictive models for
software delivery timelines [here](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/no-estimates).

Yet, reality often demands timelines, regardless of how we push back. Once an estimated date is mentioned,
it transforms dangerously into an assumed due date. This subtle shift can lead to unforeseen pressures.

### The Impact of Pressure

Under intense pressure to meet deadlines, developers might resort to shortcutsâ€”skipping tests, duplicating code, 
or writing code that's tough to read and alter. Such shortcuts compromise the quality of the software, making
future changes costly and time-consuming.

This rush sometimes comes from managers wanting the work done ASAP. If developers initially agreed to impossible
deadlines, they might ultimately bear the blame when issues arise, even if managers drove them to those decisions.

### A Historical Lesson: Apollo 13

Consider the infamous Apollo 13 mission. Engineers had forewarned management about a hardware defect under low
temperatures. But the pressure to adhere to the original launch date led to devastating consequences.
When lives were at stake, where did the true responsibility lie? With managers who disregarded warnings, or engineers
who failed to communicate the severity loudly enough?

### Creating a Culture of Transparency

When requesting timelines, emphasize them as forecasts, not deadlines. This small shift can drastically reduce pressure.
Encourage your teams to communicate uncertainty by providing a range of times instead. 
A forecast of 1-2 weeks signals low risk, whereas 1-10 weeks highlights significant unknowns and potential challenges.
This helps us prepare proactively rather than reactively.

Remember, forecasts should evolve with each project iteration. They serve not just as a measure of progress, but also
as a crucial alert system if things start veering off track.

### Plan B: The Safety Net

Always have a backup plan ready. Having alternatives empowers your team to navigate unforeseen challenges without
succumbing to potentially harmful shortcuts.

Let's build environments where developers can thrive, delivering quality without burnout. By transforming pressure
into constructive collaboration, we're not just saving time; we're safeguarding our projects and nurturing our teams
for sustainable success.

Yours,

Ed
