title: The True Essence of Agile

Many large organizations claim they are agile, but they miss the crucial aspect that agile is an organizational mindset,
not just an engineering practice.

## So what is agile?

Agile is a culture.

It must come from the top downâ€”it's the CEO's job to foster this culture.

Agile is about **trust**: trusting people to do their job.

The Agile Manifesto's principles, like communication and simplicity, inform the practices.
So do courage and feedback.

The practices exist because of the principles.

The principles exist because of the values.

Not the other way around.

The agile process is very simple.

* Asking the customer what they need.

* Extracting a small piece to build.

* Delivering it and getting feedback.

* Repeating in small loops.

Everything else is icing on the cake.

Yours,
