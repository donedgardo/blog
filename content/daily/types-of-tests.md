Do you know the secret sauce behind a rock-solid CI/CD pipeline? Test smarter, not harder! ðŸŒŸ

As we improve our CI/CD pipeline, we must know the test types that ensure software quality.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the different types of tests we use:

ðŸ§© Unit Tests:

Purpose: Verify individual pieces of code (functions/methods) in isolation.

Characteristics: Should not access the network, database, or filesystem. Use mocks/stubs for dependencies. Fast and provide early feedback.

Test a function that sums two numbers. It should not use external modules.

ðŸ”— Integration Tests:

Purpose: Ensure that different pieces of the system work together as expected.

Characteristics: Often involve actual databases, file systems, or networks. Confirm the interaction between components/modules. Generally, they are slower than unit tests.

Test data retrieval from a database. This checks if the data layer and the database schema work together.

ðŸŒŸ Acceptance Tests:

Purpose: Validate that the application meets business requirements and customer expectations.

Characteristics: Focus on functional and sometimes non-functional aspects. Operate in an environment that mirrors real-world production conditions. These do not depend on production code implementation or database details. Test new changes to ensure they do not break existing functions.

Test if a user can log in and complete a transaction. Ensure the workflow works as intended.

These tests will make our software reliable, scalable, and high-quality.
They will do so throughout its lifecycle. 

Letâ€™s all strive for better quality in every release!
