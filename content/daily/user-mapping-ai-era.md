Hello there! 👋

Yesterday we talked about clarity. Today: how to get your whole team there in one session.

Here's something AI can't do for you: **understand your users.**

An AI can generate a login flow in seconds. But it doesn't know that your users are frustrated accountants who just want to export a report and get home. It doesn't know they've been burned by three other tools this year. It doesn't know they'll abandon anything that takes more than two clicks.

That context lives in your team's heads. The trick is getting it out — and getting everyone aligned on the same picture.

I call it a **User Map**. It's a whiteboard exercise that aligns everyone before a single line of code gets written.

Here's how it works:

**1. Users on the left**
Who are we building for? What do they want? Put them on the left side of the board.

**2. Goals on the right**
What does success look like? Not features. Outcomes. Put those on the right.

**3. Fill in the middle**
Now the fun part. As a team, map out every step between "user shows up" and "user achieves goal." Every click. Every decision point. Every place they might get stuck.

**4. Find the pain**
Circle the steps where things break down. Where do users drop off? Where does the team always argue? Those circles are your priorities.

**That's it.** 60 minutes, one whiteboard, and suddenly everyone sees the same picture.

Why does this work so well?

Because most teams skip straight to solutions. "Let's add a button here." "What if we asked Claude to build a dashboard?" But they're solving problems they haven't defined yet.

The User Map forces you to understand the journey *before* you start building — whether you're writing the code yourself or prompting an AI to do it. It's slower upfront and massively faster overall.

**Pro tip:** Include everyone. Devs, designers, product, support. The person who talks to customers every day often spots problems the architects miss.

Tomorrow: how to write code as a team (and why it's not as crazy as it sounds).

Yours,
Ed
