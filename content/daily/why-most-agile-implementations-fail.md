title: Why Most Agile Implementations Fail
category: daily

There is a notion of fake agility that's suitable for corporations but doesn't work in the real world.

## Why is almost everyone doing agile wrong?

Corporations trying "agile" do things over and over by rote without really understanding why they're doing them.

Organizations are looking for a specific process they can follow (e.g., Scrum, SAFe, Kanban). But you don't get good
results by just following the process.

Process is not a canned product that fits all use cases.

I see many "certified agile" coaches who lack the respect for existing organizational processes.
They expect to replace everything with frameworks. They leave it worse than they found it. 
Then, the organization abandons agile completely.

What we want is **flexibility**; instead, we are getting "Agile says we should do X...".

### Agile says we should do X...

There are a bunch of things that are labeled as agile that people think can't be changed, but must be changed to be agile.

For example, the QA department.

In every working agile process, testing is tightly integrated into development. They test every few minutes.
When the iteration is finished, the code is so well tested that it's ready to deploy. 
This means there's nothing for the QA department to do. 
The QA director won't be happy and will fight against agile to save his job. 
In a true agile organization, they'd flexibly change their job to QA processes across teams instead.

### Agile Certification Mills

Agile seems to not work often due to certificate factories producing "Agile certifications" that have little to no value.
Reading a 16-page Scrum guide and passing a basic test does not make you an agile master.
Unfortunately, organizations often mistake these certificates for real expertise. 
They blame Agile when things go wrong, instead of the poor coaching.


### Agile Vendors

Also, some vendors support this dysfunction. Looking at you, Jira and Pivotal. 
You waste more time putting data into them than you get back in useful information.

### "Agile is for the Engineering Team"

Many large organizations claim to be agile.
But, they miss that agility is a mindset, not just an engineering practice.

*Agility is about eliminating friction by removing everything that stands in the way of delivering value to the customer.*

So that begs the question: how do we do Agile?

Let's explore that in tomorrow's email. :)
