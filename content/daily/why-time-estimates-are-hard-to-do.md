title: Why Time Estimates are Hard in Software Development

A fellow newsletter subscriber asked me:

> "How do you ensure story points are an accurate measure? Are they more accurate than using hours?"

Let's answer the second question first, as it will help in answering the first one.

### Are story points more accurate measures of estimation than time?

Answering how long a task/story will take to develop is really hard. It's very hard to guess.
Also, it burdens the developer to commit to his answer. He might say it will take two to five days.
The manager will hear it takes two days and hold the developer responsible. 
Worst of all, the developer might multiply the time by a magic number to have some wiggle room.

### Why is it so hard to come up with an accurate time estimate?

Imagine me asking you:

How long does it take you to tie your shoes?

You might think for a few seconds and tell me, like, 2 minutes.

Easy to answer, right?

Now I ask:

How long will it take you to teach someone who doesn’t know anything about shoes, laces, or physics to tie shoes?

You can’t!

That is why it is almost impossible to estimate software development time.

Tomorrow we will dig in a bit more about story points.

Yours,
