👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 1 of a 6-day dialogue on reducing work in progress.*

Stop starting. Start finishing.

Your team has 10 things in progress and nothing shipping. Every standup is a status update on stuff that's 80% done. Has been for weeks.

The problem isn't velocity. It's focus.

Work in progress is inventory. And inventory has carrying costs:
- Context switching between tasks
- Knowledge rotting while tickets sit idle
- Dependencies blocking other dependencies
- The cognitive load of tracking it all

The counterintuitive fix: do less at once. One thing, finished, is worth more than five things started.

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"That sounds nice in theory. But I have three stakeholders asking for three different things. If I focus on one, the other two escalate. My job is to keep everyone reasonably unhappy, not to optimize for flow."*

---

That's tomorrow's question.

How do you pick one thing when everyone wants everything?

Yours,
Ed
