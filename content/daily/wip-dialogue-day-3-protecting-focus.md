👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 3 of a 7-day dialogue on reducing work in progress. [Start from Day 1](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-1-stop-starting) or [read Day 2](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-2-the-prioritization-fight).*

Yesterday's question: how do you protect focus when reality attacks?

That prioritization exercise brings a subtle benefit to the table: alignment.

To quote Eisenhower: *"What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important."*

So when Monday comes, if all goes well, the team can focus on the commitment. If things go wrong (which they tend to do), we assess whether the emergency is urgent enough to warrant a shift in priorities.

If your team practices short iterations (weekly or biweekly, the shorter the better), most things can wait until the start of the next iteration and be considered then.

But shifting priorities mid-iteration has costs that need to be communicated:

**Burnout.** A team that never gets to deliver, where the goal post keeps moving just before scoring, will burn out. Turnover follows. These words scare stakeholders. They should. It's an expensive problem.

**Context switching.** You lose valuable time and mental resources. Getting back into flow is not free.

Rarely is the shift warranted.

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"What about bugs? Deployment errors? The fires that demand immediate attention?"*

That's tomorrow's question.

Yours,
Ed
