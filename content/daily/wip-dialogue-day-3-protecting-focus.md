👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 3 of a 6-day dialogue on reducing work in progress. [Start from Day 1](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-1-stop-starting) or [read Day 2](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-2-the-prioritization-fight).*

Yesterday's question: how do you protect focus when reality attacks?

That prioritization exercise brings a subtle benefit to the table: alignment.

To quote Eisenhower: *"What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important."*

So when Monday comes, if all goes well, the team can focus on the commitment. If things go wrong (which they tend to do), we assess whether the emergency is urgent enough to warrant a shift in priorities.

If your team practices short iterations (weekly or biweekly, the shorter the better), most things can wait until the start of the next iteration and be considered then.

But shifting priorities mid-iteration has costs that need to be communicated:

**Burnout.** A team that never gets to deliver, where the goal post keeps moving just before scoring, will burn out. Turnover follows. These words scare stakeholders. They should. It's an expensive problem.

**Context switching.** You lose valuable time and mental resources. Getting back into flow is not free.

Rarely is the shift warranted.

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"What about bugs? Deployment errors? The fires that demand immediate attention?"*

---

Those are a symptom of an unhealthy delivery pipeline.

Rolling back should be a click of a button. Is the team writing tests? Are deployments manual?

To go fast, you have to go well.

If your team is constantly putting out fires, the issue isn't story priority. It's building quality into the code. TDD. Acceptance tests. Constant refactoring. Deploying frequently in small batches. Automating the busy work so the team can focus on the creative, problem-solving work.

You know, the work that actually brings value to your customers.

Anything else is waste.

**Tomorrow's question:**

How do you sell "going well" to an org that only rewards "going fast"?

Yours,
Ed
