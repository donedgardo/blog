👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 4 of a 7-day dialogue on reducing work in progress. [Start from Day 1](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-1-stop-starting) or [read Day 3](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-3-protecting-focus).*

Yesterday's question: what about bugs, deployment errors, the fires that demand immediate attention?

Those are a symptom of an unhealthy delivery pipeline.

Rolling back should be a click of a button. Is the team writing tests? Are deployments manual?

To go fast, you have to go well.

If your team is constantly putting out fires, the issue isn't story priority. It's building quality into the code. TDD. Acceptance tests. Constant refactoring. Deploying frequently in small batches. Automating the busy work so the team can focus on the creative, problem-solving work.

You know, the work that actually brings value to your customers.

Anything else is waste.

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"How do you sell 'going well' to an org that only rewards 'going fast'?"*

That's tomorrow's question.

Yours,
Ed
