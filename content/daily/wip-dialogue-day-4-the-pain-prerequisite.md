👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 4 of a 6-day dialogue on reducing work in progress. [Start from Day 1](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-1-stop-starting) or [read Day 3](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-3-protecting-focus).*

Yesterday's question: how do you sell "going well" to an org that only rewards "going fast"?

An org that only rewards going fast shows smoke no matter where you look.

Internally: constant firefighting.

As a stakeholder: never seeing progress on any initiative.

As a customer: never seeing the light of day on that feature you desperately needed four months ago. Or every update comes riddled with bugs.

As a CEO: employees leaving left and right. The ones who stay have saggy eyes, no light left in them from the constant chase with no reward of accomplishment.

Selling "going well" is no longer a commodity. It's a desperate need to try something different. Because clearly what they're doing isn't working.

You can't sell something to someone who hasn't felt the pain.

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"Some orgs feel the pain but misdiagnose it. 'The team is slow because they're not working hard enough.' 'We need to hire more people.' 'Let's add a project manager.' They're in pain, but they blame individuals or reach for surface-level fixes."*

*"How do you help them connect the symptoms to the root cause?"*

Ah, the self-diagnosed patient. They feel chest pain and demand a triple bypass when a simple pill could cure the heartburn.

You can't tell them the system is broken.

You have to show them.

That's tomorrow.

Yours,
Ed
