👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 6 of a 7-day dialogue on reducing work in progress. [Start from Day 1](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-1-stop-starting) or [read Day 5](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-5-the-pain-prerequisite).*

Yesterday's question: how do you get from "we're in pain" to "our system is the problem"?

You can't argue with someone's diagnosis. You have to show them a different result.

So you don't ask permission. You run small experiments. A rebel team, tired of the same dysfunction, tries something different. They focus. They limit WIP. They collaborate. They automate. They test. They ship in small batches.

And the results show up in metrics that can't be argued with:
- Shorter lead times
- Higher deploy frequency
- Fewer defects
- Faster recovery when things go wrong

The DORA metrics. The vital signs of a healthy delivery pipeline.

When leadership notices and asks "what's that team doing differently?", the answer isn't:
- Working harder
- More resources
- A new framework
- A better project manager

It's *behaviors*. Daily practices. The way they work together.

The team is self-managing. Or more precisely, the metrics manage the team. Clear goals, clear outcomes, and the autonomy to figure out how to get there.

As a manager, your job is to get out of the way. Provide air cover. Remove obstacles.

You can't *tell* them the system is broken. You have to *show* them.

**The skeptic pushes back:**

*"This works when you have a rebel team willing to try. But what if everyone's too burned out to rebel? Too beaten down to believe things could be different?"*

*"Where does the first spark come from when everyone's given up?"*

That's tomorrow. The final question.

Yours,
Ed
