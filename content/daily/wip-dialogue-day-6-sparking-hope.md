👋 Hello there!

*This is Day 6, the final day of a 6-day dialogue on reducing work in progress. [Start from Day 1](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-1-stop-starting) or [read Day 5](https://edgardocarreras.com/daily/wip-dialogue-day-5-show-dont-tell).*

Yesterday's question: where does the first spark come from when everyone's given up?

Is hope really lost? If that's the case, it's time to close up shop.

But that's seldom the reality. In the midst of disaster, the people who stick through are the ones still holding onto hope.

And that hope can be sparked through a culture shift:

From "failure shall be punished" to "failing is acceptable."

From managing through fear or bureaucratic rules to making decisions based on goals and mission.

From an ego mindset to a humble one that admits we don't know anything.

From ignoring people's wins to respecting where they're coming from.

From second-guessing our people to trusting they have the best intentions.

In a workplace like this, anything is achievable.

This becomes your people's culture. The kind of people you want around you. This is how we as leaders give that spark to light the way forward.

**The arc:**

We started with a simple idea: stop starting, start finishing. Limit work in progress.

But that led us deeper:
- How do you prioritize when everyone wants everything? *Get them in a room. Make them fight it out. Value vs effort.*
- How do you protect focus when reality attacks? *Short iterations. Communicate the cost of switching.*
- What about the fires? *They're symptoms of a broken pipeline. Build quality in.*
- How do you sell "going well"? *You can't, until they've felt the pain.*
- How do you show them the system is broken? *Small experiments. Rebel teams. Undeniable metrics.*
- How do you spark hope when everyone's given up? *Culture shift. Leadership that creates safety.*

The answer to all of it: behaviors, practiced daily, protected by leaders who believe outcomes matter more than optics.

That's the work.

Yours,
Ed
